## Introduction
Ever returned from the market with a bunch of ingredients, only to find yourself clueless about how to transform them into delicious dishes? Or, perhaps you've wanted to experiment with new culinary creations but didn't know where to start. This is where our project comes in! We've developed a system for ingredient and recipe analysis. Simply tell the system what ingredients you have, and it will suggest a variety of dishes you can prepare!

## K_web2
This directory contains our final code.
- `home.html`: The main webpage interface.
- `login.html`: User login screen.
- `register.html`: User registration screen.
- `like_button.js`: Manages the operation of the like button on the page.
- `list.js`, `list.php`: Enables searching for ingredients in the database via the webpage.
- `fridge.php`: Backend management of ingredients in the fridge.
- `add.php`, `less.php`, `rm_ingr.php`: Functions to add, reduce, or delete ingredients in the fridge and update the backend.
- `index.php`: Used to query the backend.

## sql_files
Contains the SQL queries performed on the backend database.

## processed_data
This includes four key data files:
- `ingr.csv`
- `rcp_info.csv`
- `rcp_ingr.csv`
- `user_ingr.csv`

These files comprise the data we used in our project.

## Others
Other folders are for temporary files.

## How to Run?

1. Install and start XAMPP on your computer.
